// Q1 (total 30). 
1) At least 5 popular categories; 4/4 (top 16 categories)
2) Input to clusterings have both location + categories; 4/4 

3) Heuristic to find number of clusters; 4/6 (error of kmeans should be monotonically decreasing)

4) Output meaningful cluster labels; 4/4 

5) kmeans + hierarchical + gmm; 6/6

6) Explanation of parameters; 6/6

// Q2 (total 10)
7) Clusters have little overlap; 3/5 (there is quite some overlap in all clustering methods)

8) Visualization has cluster labels; 5/5 

// Q3 (outliers) (10 points)
9) Outliers for K-means; 4/5 (outlier should be defined by unique id which is location (lat,lon), also 

10) Observations about outliers; 0/5: 

11) (bonus) : Outliers for other clusterings; 0/3 

// Q4 (total 10)
12) Brief explanation of 3 clustering methods implemented above; 10/10
