    "# Predicting Number of Comments for Blogs ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will work on blog posts. The deadline is ** Nov. 19 5pm **. The goal is to determine the number of comments a post will receive in the next 24 hours. You can find the details of the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/19p7QBjH2Ai37MJcixiQ5UKlC0kw9l2Yd/view?usp=sharing). The data are stored in .csv files and each row of the dataset corresponds to a distinct blog (data instance). \n",
    "\n",
    "For information regarding the dataset and the features included in it please refer to the included README.md file.\n",
    "\n",
    "As learned in class most algorithms can only handle numeric values so we provided a dataset containing numeric values. The algorithms you are going to evaluate are the following: 1) Linear Regression, 2) Logistic Regression, 3) KNN, 4) Decision Tree Classifiers. Tasks 1 and 2 are related to regression to analyze this information, while tasks 3 and 4 are related to classification.\n",

    "### Task 1\n",

    "First, we will fit a linear regression model that predicts the number of comments a post will receive. Use the model to analyze the important factors that decide the number of comments of a blog. \n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we will fit a logistic regression model that decides if a blog post is popular or not. In order to do so, note that you need to define a binary attribute on which you can fit the logistic regression model. As before, use the model to analyze the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we are going to use the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to decide if a blog post is popular or not. Please use the same popularity definition as in task 2, for this task. KNN is an instant-based classification which simply stores instances of the training data. Then, classification is computed from a majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point.\n",
